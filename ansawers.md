A3:It provides information regarding "git add" and its different tags and how those are used (Something along those lines should be good for an answer).<br>
A4: They should see both README.md and answers.md files not being tracked and be in red color. (Anything along those lines work. Answers need to make sense)<br>
A5: README.md file is in the staging area and is being tracked now and its color is green while answers.md is still red and not tracked.<br>
A6: answers.md file has been added to the staging area is being tracked. <br>
**Note: There are 2 answers for A7 depends if they have been adding everytime they change anything in answers.md file** <br>

**Note: Both A7_1 and A7_2 are correct. Anything along those lines also works**<br>
A8: It records the number of commits done. <br>

        Initial commit<br>
A9: Their git-lab repo changes from "quicksetup guide" to repo holding their README.md and answers.md file<br>
A10: No change. This is because changes were made online which didnt change the local repo on my laptop/computer<br>
A11: Remote contains work that the local doesnt have so there is conflict. <br>
A12: Yes the changes were made.<br>
        I can see this being added to my local README.md file<br>
